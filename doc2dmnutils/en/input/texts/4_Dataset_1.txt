The menu will depend on the day of the week and the current weather.

If the day is Tuesday and the weather is rainy, herb sandwiches need to be prepared.

On the other hand, in case of rainy weather on Tuesday, tomato sandwiches need to be made.

Whenever the day is Wednesday and the weather is sunny, ceasar sandwiches need to be made.

Further, if the day is Wednesday and the weather is rainy on the other hand, fish-salad sandwiches need to be made.
