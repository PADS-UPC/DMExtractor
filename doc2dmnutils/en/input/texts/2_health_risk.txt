The health risk level of a patient should be assessed from the obesity level, waist circumference and the sex of the patient.


Furthermore, the obesity level should be determined from the BMI value and sex of the patient.


Patient's height and weight are considered to calculate his BMI value.


If the patient's sex is male and his BMI value is between 25 and 29.9, then his obesity level is normal.


If the patient's sex is female and the BMI value is above 25.0 and less than 30, then the obesity level is overweight.


Where as, if the BMI value is 30.0 or higher, the obesity level falls within the obese 1 range.
