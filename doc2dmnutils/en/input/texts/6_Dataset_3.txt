Our service level agreement is very strict.

This passage explains how much euros should be charged extra in certain events.

The cost is defined by the service request and the customer's phase.

Whenever the customer is in the testing phase and the customer's service request is a change request, the cost is 600 euros.

If the customer is in the testing phase and the service request is a bug, then 0 euros should be charged to the cost.

We wouldn't want to charge bugs.

Further, if the service request is a change request and the phase is development, then 150 euros should be charged as cost.

If the service request is a bug and the phase is testing however, the customer should be charged a cost of 0 euros.

Finally, if the customer is in the maintenance phase and the service request is a change request, then the cost is 100.

If the service request is a bug and the customer is in maintenance, then the cost should be 50 euros.
