Health evaluation criteria consider both physical health score and mental health score of a patient.

The physical health score is determined from the physical fitness score, BMI based health risk level and healthiness of senses.

Physical fitness score is calculated from the sex of a patient and results of various tests such as strength test, coordination test, agility test, stamina test and speed test.

The patient's risk level should be assessed by determining the obesity level based on BMI value, also on the waist circumference.

The obesity level or degree of overweight should be assessed by determining the BMI value.

If the weight of the patient is given in kgs and length of patient is given in meters, then the BMI value is weight/(length*length).
